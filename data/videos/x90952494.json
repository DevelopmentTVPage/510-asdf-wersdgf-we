Here on this release Neogoa\u2019s mysterious collaborators explore experimental realms ranging from dark and acidic Goa trance to eerie and occult ambient atmospheres, all perfectly crafted to bring the listener on a 75 minute journey into the world beyond. \n\nFree download: http:\/\/www.neogoa.net\/the-world-beyond\/\n\nFor more free Goa trance and ambient music, please visit us:\n\nWebsite - https:\/\/www.neogoa.net\nFacebook - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/neogoarecords\nTwitter - https:\/\/www.twitter.com\/neogoarecords\nInstagram - https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/neogoarecords\nSoundcloud - https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/neogoarecords\nGoogle+ - https:\/\/plus.google.com\/+neogoarecords\nBandcamp - https:\/\/neogoarecords.bandcamp.com",

    "description": "Neogoa is proud to present Kolovrat, the long-awaited debut album by Croatian duo Lunar Dawn. Since the release of the Blessings From Irij single and remix album Lunar Dawn defined a fresh approach for new material inspired mainly by ancient and colorful Slavic folklore and mythology. Kolovrat has been crafted during a three year time frame and features 10 previously unreleased tracks including two collaborative works, one with the well-known Croatian ethno\/neofolk band Svarica and another featuring Jasmina on vocals. Prepare yourself for a unique experience of Goa trance music made with the playfulness, emotive power, and passion typical of the Balkan peninsula! All tracks written and produced by Lunar Dawn (Kristijan Ili\u0161inovi\u0107 and Sa\u0161a Pre\u010danica), Croatia. Live instruments on track #1 by Svarica; vocals on track #10 by Jasmina.

    "description": "After the successful release of his debut album Illusions Of Reality back in 2013 on Timewarp Records, Hungarian project Journey Into Sound (JIS) will take you on another truly magical voyage into the world of melodic Goa trance music with Transdimensional Vision, his first release on the Balkan-based Neogoa Records. Inspired by trance classics, Czell\u00e1r G\u00e1bor, the man behind this project, is on a mission to bring something special to new school Goa trance.

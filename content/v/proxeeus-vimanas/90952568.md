    "description": "At The Mountains Of Madness is the debut album of French Goa trance producer Jerome Lesterps, better known as Proxeeus. Since his appearance on the Celestial Transvibrations compilation, Neogoa and Proxeeus have been working very hard to introduce his talent in full-length form and deliver this debut album to Goa trance fans around the world. This release also celebrates the 5th anniversary of Neogoa Records, international netlabel day, and the opening of the new Proxeeus website. Inspired by H. P. Lovecraft themes, this album delivers mad and energetic acid-driven Goa trance music with high-octane melodies and grooves. This unusual combination of interesting concepts will bring a listener on a proper journey while reinstating acid vibes into Goa trance in a big way. All tracks written and produced by Jerome Lesterps (France).

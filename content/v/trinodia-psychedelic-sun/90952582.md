    "description": "Underground Alien Factory Records and Neogoa join forces once more to present Future Architecture 2, the sequel to the highly successful original released back in 2011. After 15 months of hard work on this project, label heads Imba and Richpa finally completed the compilation process after carefully selecting some of the finest psychedelia Goa trance tunes from their respective HQs:\n\nWith the Future Architecture 2, we wanted to create a perfect balance between the \u201cechoes\u201d of retro Goa trance sound and the energy of new wave of Goa music, as well as paying an extra attention to the storytelling and the flow of the compilation itself. The focus and the goal of both netlabels with this release is to bring back some old artists back in the game, as well as to present some fresh ideas on our releases for the first time. In the end, the promotion of Goa trance music and culture still is the number one priority for both of us.\n\nMastering by Igor \u010cerani\u0107 (Deimos) at Deimos Soundlabs, with artwork design by Ivan Pari\u0107 (Richpa) at Neogoa Design, using photos by Alexander Synaptic.\n\n01 - GoaTree - Human Apocalypto (80\/106 BPM) \n02 - Crossing Mind - Virtual Mind Cleaner (139 BPM) \n03 - Aerosis - Cape Quetzal (138 BPM) \n04 - Celestial Intelligence - Light After Darkness (143 BPM) \n05 - Adrenalin Run - Spoiled Brats (Premature Incubation Mix) (145 BPM) \n06 - Dreamweaver - Penta (145 BPM) \n07 - Cosmic Dimension - Alien Civilization (142 BPM) \n08 - Trinodia - Psychedelic Sun (137 BPM) \n09 - Magic Science & Imba - Ghost Town (144 BPM) \n10 - Omnivox - Inner Polarity (2014 Rework) (147 BPM)\n\nFree download: http:\/\/www.ektoplazm.com\/free-music\/future-architecture-2\n\nFor more free Goa trance and ambient music, please visit us:\n\nWebsite - https:\/\/www.neogoa.net\nFacebook - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/neogoarecords\nTwitter - https:\/\/www.twitter.com\/neogoarecords\nInstagram - https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/neogoarecords\nSoundcloud - https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/neogoarecords\nGoogle+ - https:\/\/plus.google.com\/+neogoarecords\nBandcamp - https:\/\/neogoarecords.bandcamp.com",
